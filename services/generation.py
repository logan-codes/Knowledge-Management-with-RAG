For convenience, separate methods are offered to convert single documents or batches of documents. A basic usage example is illustrated below. Further examples are available in the Doclign code repository.\nfrom docling.document_converter import DocumentConverter\n```\nsource = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01062" # PDF path or URL converter = DocumentConverter() result = converter.convert_single(source) print(result.render_as_markdown()) # output: "## DocLayNet: A Large Human -Annotated Dataset for Document -Layout Analysis [...]"\n```\nOptionally, you can configure custom pipeline features and runtime options, such as turning on or off features (e.g. OCR, table structure recognition), enforcing limits on the input document size, and defining the budget of CPU threads.
